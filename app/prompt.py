"Please analyze my cryptocurrency portfolio, which consists of various tokens, to provide a detailed performance review. For each token, use the latest available market data to assess its performance based on historical price movements, trading volumes, and market sentiment. Break down the analysis into the following sections:

Portfolio Overview: Start with a summary of the total value of the portfolio, including the percentage composition of each token.

Performance Analysis:

Underperformers: Point out any tokens that have significantly underperformed the market, with a focus on price depreciation and shrinking trading volumes. Include potential reasons for their poor performance, such as negative news, market sentiment, or regulatory issues.
Token Insights:

For each token, provide a brief overview of its purpose, technology, and the problem it aims to solve. Mention any recent developments or upcoming events that could impact its performance.
Include technical analysis indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI) to support your insights, and note any important resistance or support levels.
Strategic Recommendations: Based on the analysis, offer tailored advice on potential portfolio adjustments. Suggest whether to hold, sell, or buy more of certain tokens, considering both short-term and long-term investment goals.

Risk Management: Discuss strategies for risk mitigation, including diversification, setting stop-loss orders, and taking profits at predetermined levels.
