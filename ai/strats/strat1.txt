HODL Strategy for Bull Market

Identify Early Bull Market: Recognize the beginning of a bull market by looking for signs of increasing market sentiment and price momentum across major tokens.
Focus on Strong Projects: Invest in fundamentally strong and well-established projects.
Avoid Chasing Green Candles: Don't buy into tokens that have already experienced significant short-term price increases.
Look for Good Rotations: Identify tokens that are strong but havenâ€™t yet experienced significant gains.
Lower Market Cap Tokens: Consider lower market cap tokens as they often have more room to grow compared to larger, more established assets.
Take Profits Gradually: As prices rise, take profits incrementally to lock in gains while still benefiting from further price increases.
Be Patient: Expect big moves but stay patient, allowing investments to grow over time.
Vetted Assets: Ensure that all assets are thoroughly vetted, but remember that no investment is without risk.
